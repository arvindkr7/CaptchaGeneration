# CaptchaGeneration
Its initiative by me take a step ahead towards generating a captch for secure login and verification purpose in python.
# you need basic understanding of pyhton programmng language
class and object concepts for making the code simpler and readable, understanding and resusing of functions
importing libraries like tkinter for GUI, messagebox for poping up notifications(such as information, errors and warnings)
importing random from numpy to generate random numbers. its impossible to predict what number would be generated

# Now coming to running part. thats
firstly, you need to check the box and click submit to get captcha
Next step, the captcha would be displayed and beside that refresh button to generate new and another captcha
# You need to answer the sum of captcha displaying
# if you fail to enter correct captcha, You would be prompted 'Didn't match' and another captcha would be generated
# Moreover, I have tried my best to make it more sensitive with different and multple constraints.
